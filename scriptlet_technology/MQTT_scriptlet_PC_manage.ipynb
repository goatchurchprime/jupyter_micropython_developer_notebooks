      " |  =========\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  A number of callback functions are available to receive data back from the\n",

      " |          session information for the client. If 1, the session still exists.\n",
      " |    The value of rc determines success or not:\n",

      " |      1: Connection refused - incorrect protocol version\n",
